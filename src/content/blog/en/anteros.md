    "**<a href='https://anteros.cl' target='_blank' class='text-orange-400'>Anteros S.A.</a>**, a leading company in the import of industrial machinery, faced a critical challenge: digitizing and optimizing its sales processes without replacing its core system, a functional but outdated Manager ERP. The initial need was clear: to create a lightweight platform that could interact with this ERP, facilitating the work of the sales team in the field, a key aspect of the forestry sector.\n",

    "An ambitious but necessary goal. Like any other muscle, digitization requires constant training.\nFollowing an audit, we proposed a low-risk solution as the first stage of the project: an <a class='text-orange-400' href='https://fuix.cl/es/services/mvp' target='_blank'>MVP (Minimum Viable Product)</a>.\nThe strategy was to develop a non-intrusive API (Express.js) capable of operating directly with the existing ERP data. The MVP was developed with two main focuses: **integration with the existing ERP** and **delivering value to the sales team**.\n",

    "The **sales portal** allowed sales representatives to check product availability, prices, and create order notes directly from the platform in real time.",
    "We connected our Express API with WooCommerce to synchronize stock, prices, and photos as well as attachments (manuals, part diagrams, etc.), automating marketing tasks.\n",
    "The MVP gradually gained new functionalities. After six months, we decided to share these features with Anteros' customers through a **customer portal**.\n",

    "The **customer portal**, with an OTP (One-Time Password) authentication system linked to their Manager ERP email, allowed customers to review their purchases, order statuses, and quotes independently.\n",

    "The implementation of the MVP was a success. Thanks to its agile development and non-intrusive integration, Anteros was able to digitize its processes without disrupting daily operations. The new platform improved the mobility of the sales team, increased efficiency in order note creation, and enhanced customer satisfaction by providing transparent access to their information.\n",
    "This success story demonstrates how an agile and solution-oriented approach can modernize critical business processes without replacing existing systems. Fuix continues to collaborate with Anteros on new stages to expand the platform's functionalities, incorporating more automation and optimization tools in future phases.",
